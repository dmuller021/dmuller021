### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dion, I'm currently 25 years old and I have been studying software development for 3 years (mainly focussed on web development)

I consider myself a beginner web developer. My main focus is to develop my skills in Laravel, at the moment I have no projects that I'm working due to my education. 

My goal is to become a decent full stack developer and being able to work for a wonderful company.

So far what I've learned at school/internship:

- C# basics
- PHP
- Laravel:
    - MVC
    - Migrations
    - Routes
    - Middleware
    - Artisan commands
    - Components
    - Model relationships
    - Google 2FA
  
- HTML5
- CSS (some tailwind experience too)
- Some JS (vanilla)
- MySQL
- Bootstrap 5 (mainly about grid)
- Agile
- Scrum
- Documenting
