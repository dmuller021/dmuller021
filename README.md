### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dion, I'm currently 23 years old and I have been studying software development for 1,5 years (mainly focussed on web development)

I consider myself a beginner web developer. For now, my main focus is to learn Laravel and make wonderful projects with it. Currently, I'm working on a pwa for my company.

My goal for now is to become a decent full stack developer.

So far what I've learned at school:

- C# basics
- PHP
- HTML5
- CSS
- MySQL
- Bootstrap basics



Additional info:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: app_pwa (see my repositories) 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Laravel, Javascript, Bootstrap 5 and CSS
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: php basics or phpmyadmin
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Instagram (@dmindoo) or here
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've studied IT management twice (niveau 2 & 3 MBO)
